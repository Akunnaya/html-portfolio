<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Named Favour Akunnaya. </p>
<p>I'm a university graduate with a second degree upper honours in applied microbiology and brewing.</p>
<p>While i love my degree so much, i am also currently pursuing a career in tech. I have always been fascinated by 
  technology and gadgtes and all what you can get out of it. Now that i have the time, thankfully a sponsor, the resources
  and a wonderful instructore to guide me through it, i am giving it my best shot.  </p>
<p>With all that said and out of the way, it's nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at the top, cheers.</p>
