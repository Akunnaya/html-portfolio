<h1>BEST Animes ACCORDING TO NAYA</h1>
<H2>My Top Three Animes Of All-Time</H2>
<h3>Demon slayer</h3>
<p> This has to be the best anime i have seen so far, its a nice blend of emotions,action and really beautiful images.</p>
<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>All i can say is that i am in love with the story line and of course, the character asta.</p>
<h3>Terius</h3>
<p>This is the only kdrama i saw completely without skipping and that saying a lot cos i'm not the biggest kdrama fan. 
    It has a nice blend of romance, action and comedy. i just love lovee loveee it.
